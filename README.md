## My Favorite Movie
My first repository

My Favorite movie is **`Wednesday`**.

**Wednesday's personality**
- is severe, with a deadpan wit and a morbid interest in trying to inflict harm upon her brothers, first Pugsley and later Pubert. In both films, she is played by Christina Ricci.
- she is a unique mixture of being visionary and realistic.
- With a rare ability to remain focused for long periods of time
-  is able to come up with a carefully thought out plan and then execute it accordingly.

**Her Family is:**

  1. **Gomez Addams**
      - was the nameless patriarch of the family. He had a somewhat grotesque appearance, with a tubby body, a snub-nose, a crooked tooth and a receding chin. He was often depicted reading in the den or lounging on the windowsill.
    
  2. **Morticia Addams**
      - first appeared in Charles Addams' newspaper cartoons as the stern, aloof matriarch of the family. She often appeared with the rest of the family, and was, along with Gomez and Grandmama, one of the few members to actually speak in the cartoons.
  
  3. **Pugsley Addams**
       - is depicted as a devious, young, brilliant boy in Charles Addams's original cartoons. He is often shown releasing sailboats in the park with other children, except his boats were more macabre in nature.
   
   4. **Thing (The Addams Family)**
       - called it "Thing" because it was something that could not be identified. It is known as "Cosa" (Thing) in Spain, "Dedos" (Fingers) in Hispanic America, "Mano" (Hand) in Italy and "eiskaltes HÃ¤ndchen" (stonecold little hand) in German.
    
   5. **Uncle Fester**
       - is a completely hairless, hunched, and barrel-shaped man with dark, sunken eyes and often a deranged smile. He always wears a heavy, full-length fur coat. Fester was derived from a character drawn by cartoonist Charles Addams, although these were single-page cartoons, with no stories or character names.
